    "question": "How is Ryfts different from the alternatives",
    "answer": "Ryfts differs from conventional lottery systems by implementing a variety of refreshing and convenient game models opposed to only one fixed model that’s used by traditional lotteries. In this way, it provides the players with unmatched flexibility in choosing and knowing how much they want to bet, how many players they’re going to compete against and for how long they’re going to wait for the delivery of the prizes while keeping it all as simple, transparent and accessible as possible. Currently there is no real raffle built upon blockchain, only the lottery systems that are not really decentralized. We plan to build a game that is simple to use and most importantly with eye catching graphics and animation that will attract even broader audience.",
