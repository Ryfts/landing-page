									<p>Ryfts is based on an Ethereum smart contract. It is executed by the Ethereum network, which enables it to operate in a partially decentralized fashion to provide a transparent, provably fair gambling service with our random number being as the only external dependency for our smart-contract. Once our Ethereum smart contract receives a random number from random.org, the results are calculated against the number you submitted and winning bets are paid out instantly.</p>

									<p>The current format of lottery games around the world has a number of disadvantages concerning fair draws, accessibility, anonymity and speed of payouts. Blockchain and cryptocurrency fully solve these issues. Ethereum smart contracts make it possible to achieve full transparency and fairness of each draw. All platform working conditions laid down in the contract make it possible for players to be completely sure that if they win they will receive their prizes immediately after the draw, since the payouts and all draw processes are carried out by the contract itself, so it is impossible to interfere with the working conditions. This allows players to be confident in one hundred percent fair play and also guarantees the payout of prizes of any amounts with full transparency of all processes taking place within the platform.</p>

									<p>Ryfts differs from conventional lottery systems by implementing a variety of refreshing and convenient game models opposed to only one fixed model that’s used by traditional lotteries. In this way, It provides the players with unmatched flexibility in choosing and knowing how much they want to bet, how many players they’re going to compete against and for how long they’re going to wait for the delivery of the prizes while keeping it all as simple, transparent and accessible as possible. The pools and the prizes are entirely comprised of the players’ bets and there’s no direct involvement from the house whatsoever in the betting scheme except for a marginal fee.</p>

									<p>One of the important advantages offered by the use of smart contracts in a lottery is that the payouts, as well as all draws, are made by the contract itself, i.e. automatically and without the intervention of third parties, including Ryfts developers.</p>
									<p>By purchasing a ticket, players can be fully confident that the draw is 100% fair and transparent, and, if they win, they will immediately get all the prizes in their cryptocurrency wallet, which was linked when the game account was created, and nobody will be able to prevent it.</p>
